### Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Tkinter (for GUI)
* `playsound` (for beep on error)
* `threading` (non-blocking sound playback)

---

### How It Works

1. A reference paragraph appears on screen.
2. User starts typing — the timer begins automatically.
3. Mistyped characters play a short beep sound.
4. After 60 seconds, the app calculates:

   * **WPM (Words Per Minute)**
   * **CPM (Characters Per Minute)**
   * **Accuracy (%)**
5. User can toggle between dark/light themes and retry.
